# Proxy-Server
### **Overview**:

A web proxy acts as an intermediary between a client (e.g., a browser) and a server. When the client makes a request, it goes through the proxy, which fetches the requested content and returns it to the client. Proxies are widely used for caching, filtering, and anonymity.

### **Key Features**:

1. **Request Forwarding**:
    - Intercept HTTP/HTTPS requests from the client.
    - Forward them to the appropriate destination server.
2. **Response Handling**:
    - Fetch the response from the server and pass it back to the client.
3. **Caching** (Optional):
    - Store copies of responses to reduce repeated requests for the same resource.
4. **Filtering** (Optional):
    - Block certain types of content, such as ads or specific websites.
5. **Logging**:
    - Track client requests and responses for debugging or analytics.

### **Technologies to Use**:

- **Languages**: Python (using libraries like `socket` or `http.server`)
- **Libraries**: `socket`, `http.server`, or `requests`.

### **Challenges**:

1. **Handling HTTPS**:
    - To support HTTPS, you may need to implement SSL tunneling (e.g., using the CONNECT method).
2. **Concurrency**:
    - Manage multiple client connections using threading, async programming, or event loops.
3. **Cache Management**:
    - Implement efficient cache eviction policies like Least Recently Used (LRU).

### **Steps to Build**:

1. **Set Up a Basic HTTP Proxy**:
    - Use sockets to listen for client requests and forward them to servers.
    - Read and write HTTP headers.
2. **Add Response Forwarding**:
    - Fetch responses from the server and send them back to the client.
3. **Implement Caching (Optional)**:
    - Cache static resources like images or stylesheets.
    - Use a dictionary or database to store cached content.
4. **Enhance Features**:
    - Add logging to monitor requests and responses.
    - Implement filtering to block specific domains or file types.
5. **Test**:
    - Test the proxy with different types of websites, including dynamic ones.

### **Use Cases**:

- Learning about HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
- Experimenting with content filtering or caching.
- Building a small-scale tool for anonymous browsing.
